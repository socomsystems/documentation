==================================
Desktop and mobile synchronization
==================================

For synchronizing files with your desktop computer, we recommend using the
`cyfrSpaces Sync Client`_ for Windows, macOS and Linux.


The cyfrSpaces Desktop Sync Client enables you to connect to your cyfrSpaces Server.
You can create folders in your home directory, and keep the contents of those
folders synced with your cyfrSpaces server. Simply copy a file into the directory
and the cyfrSpaces desktop client does the rest. Make a change to the files on one
computer, it will flow across the others using these desktop sync clients.
You will always
have your latest files with you wherever you are.

Its usage is documented separately in the `cyfrSpaces Desktop Client Manual`_.
